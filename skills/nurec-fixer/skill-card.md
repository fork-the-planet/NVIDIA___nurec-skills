## Description: <br>
Use to run NVIDIA DiffusionHarmonizer (public successor to the older Fixer recipes) to enhance, harmonize, evaluate, or fine-tune novel-view frames from NRE / NuRec / 3DGS / NeRF reconstructions. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need to enhance, harmonize, or evaluate rendered frames from neural reconstruction pipelines (NRE, NuRec, 3DGS, NeRF) using NVIDIA DiffusionHarmonizer. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Shell commands, Configuration instructions, Files] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline bash code blocks] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated through NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier evaluation framework (profile: external). Tier 1: 9 static validation checks; Tier 2: 2 deduplication checks. Overall verdict: PASS. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
