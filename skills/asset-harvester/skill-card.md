## Description: <br>
Use to install and run NVIDIA Asset Harvester (Apache-2.0) to extract per-object 3D Gaussian Splat assets (gaussians.ply) from AV NCore V4 clips or masked single images via SparseViewDiT + TokenGS, optionally producing metadata.yaml for NuRec object insertion. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need to extract per-object 3D Gaussian Splat assets from autonomous-vehicle driving-log clips or masked images for simulation in NVIDIA Omniverse NuRec. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
